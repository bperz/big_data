Tasks from big data lab

Stanford web graph (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Stanford.html) used in some tasks from lab 5.

Lab 1:

    Task:
      - Building wordcloud from words in a book

Lab 2:

    Task 1:
      - divide book into chapters (treat each chapter as separate document)
      - TF-IDF for all words in all chapters
      - wordclouds for each chapter
      
    Task 2:
      - words with highest TF-IDF
      - for given word list most matching chapters (according to TF-IDF)

Lab 3:

    Task 1:
      - Jaccard distance of documents on k-shingles
    Task 2:
      - Jaccard distance approximation using min-hash
    
Lab 4:

    Task 1:
      - Task 1 from lab 1 using Map-Reduce
    
    Task 2:
      - Map-Reduce for calculating at the same time:
        - largest and smallest number
        - average of all numbers
        - set of elements (list without repetition)
        - number of different elements
        * additional counting all elements for average and debugging
      
    Task 3:
      - most related (side by side) words in a book
      - random paragraph generation
    
Lab 5:

    Task 1:
      - reversing a graph
    
    Task 2:
      - calculating degrees in a graph
      - average degree in a graph
    
    Task 3:
      - calculating clustering coefficient
